# NoVibe for Claude Code

### Be the driver, not the passenger.

**Spec-driven development for Claude Code.**

*AI made writing code cheap. The work that matters — deciding what to build, designing it,
proving it right — didn't change. **NoVibe makes you do it first.***

---

> **Vibe coding:** describe it, ship it, audit what the machine made. Trapped in review hell.
> **NoVibe:** spec-driven — you author the spec and the design; the machine builds to them, and
> the **executable spec proves it**. The `.feature` file isn't documentation of the code; the
> code is an implementation of the spec.

## ✨ What you get

A guided flow, plus the specialists it runs — each also usable on its own:

| Invoke | What it does for you |
|---|---|
| **`novibe`** | drives a change end to end — spec → design → tests — one step at a time |
| **`requirements-engineer`** | pins *what* to build as business scenarios you can read and test |
| **`architect`** | turns the spec into a clear C4 design (and a terse ADR only when it matters) |
| **`developer`** | builds it test-first — red → green — so it's proven, not hoped |

## 📦 Install

```
/plugin marketplace add novibe-org/nv-plugins
/plugin install novibe
```

## 🚀 Use

Ask Claude to build something **the NoVibe way** (or invoke `novibe`). It walks the
spec-driven flow one step at a time and **pauses for your call between steps** — the spec and
the model are the contract; code is their consequence:

1. **Specify** it as business scenarios.
2. **Design** it in the architecture model.
3. **Build** it test-first.

Only need one part? Invoke `architect`, `requirements-engineer`, or `developer` directly.
Skip NoVibe for trivial edits.
